ARDUINO ON RAMP
Go from ZERO to ONE learning to use the Arduino environment to build electronics projects. Class will review development boards, software and basic electronic components while walking the group through a project.


The goal of this class is to introduce a beginner to the world of micro-electronics' development boards,
get you started with the software, a discuss how to control a few components, put together a straight forward project,  and highlight a few available resources so that each participant has some direction on next actions they can take to learn more, build more, connect more when they leave.

Prerequisites:  1) Bring Own laptop.  No Chromebooks.

2) Download Arduino IDE: 
go to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage
Scroll down to "Install the Arduino IDE"
Click on whichever operating system you have: Windows, Linux, Mac
Follow step by step directions

3) download files for this class:
https://github.com/haleyma/Arduino-On-Ramp-Class
Make a new folder on your computer(Maybe ArduinoOnRamp?).  Go to the link above on github and click the green button to the right, choose download .zip, and extract into your folder.

4. These Arduinos use the CH340 USB serial driver.  You need to install that driver on your computer.  Follow these instructions from Instructables.Com.
